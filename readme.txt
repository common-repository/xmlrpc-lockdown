## Description

XMLRPC Lockdown by AO Digital is an advanced version of the XMLRPC Lockdown plugin for WordPress. This plugin blocks access to xmlrpc.php for all requests except those from allowed services like Jetpack, the WordPress mobile application, and other specified services. It is designed to enhance your site's security against xmlrpc attacks while maintaining functionality for essential tools.
